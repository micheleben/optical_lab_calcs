The transition from the GEX to the OHT FDA product classification for laser hair removal devices was a regulatory change introduced around 2006 to create a distinct category for consumer-use products. 

The change from GEX to OHT seems to reflect a shift in how the FDA classifies these devices based on their intended use and regulatory controls.

GEX Product Code (Powered Laser Surgical Instrument): This classification is for professional-use devices intended for general surgical and dermatological purposes, operated by trained professionals. The regulatory focus is on the device's function in a controlled clinical environment. You can find more details on its official FDA classification page:

OHT Product Code (Light Based Over-The-Counter Hair Removal): This new classification was established for devices that are safe and effective for consumer use in a non-clinical, home environment. The FDA created this new category to apply specific regulatory standards for safety and user-friendliness, acknowledging the different risk profile of an over-the-counter product versus a surgical instrument.

In essence, the creation of the OHT product code allowed the FDA to properly regulate consumer-grade devices under their own unique set of standards, separate from the more powerful, professionally operated surgical instruments classified under GEX.
