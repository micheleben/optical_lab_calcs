## FDA 510(k) Device Analysis: GEX to OHT Transition

### Table 1: Comprehensive Device Comparison with Energy Analysis

| Device | 510(k) Number | Year | Product Code | User Type | Wavelength (nm) | Beam Size | Area (cm²) | Energy Density Range (J/cm²) | Max Energy Density (J/cm²) | Max Total Energy (J)* |
|--------|---------------|------|--------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **TRIA** | K090820 | 2009 | **GEX** | Consumer | ~800 | Φ 10mm | 0.785 | 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 | 22 | 17.3 |
| **SILKPRO** | K142845 | 2015 | **OHT** | Consumer | 810 | 9×9mm | 0.81 | 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 | 25 | 20.3 |
| **IVYLASER** | K230025 | 2023 | **OHT** | Consumer | 808 | 9×18mm | 1.62 | 1.85, 3.09, 6.17, 9.26, 15.43 | 15.43 | 25.0 |
| **Diode Laser (Lotuxs V8)** | K230090 | 2023 | **OHT** | Consumer | 810 | 30×10mm | 3.0 | 2.2, 3.4, 4.5, 5.6, 7.0, 9.0 | 9.0 | 27.0 |
| **Diode Laser (Lotuxs V4)** | K230090 | 2023 | **OHT** | Consumer | 810 | 30×10mm | 3.0 | 2.0, 2.8, 3.5, 4.3, 5.3, 7.0 | 7.0 | 21.0 |

*Max Total Energy = Max Energy Density × Beam Area

### Key Technical Observations:

**Energy Density Evolution**: The transition from GEX to OHT did not result in universally lower energy densities. The 2015 SILKPRO (OHT) actually had higher maximum energy density (25 J/cm²) than the 2009 TRIA (GEX, 22 J/cm²). However, later OHT devices show more conservative energy limits.

**Professional vs Consumer Applications**: The 2018 professional GEX device (K181019) maintains the highest energy density range (5-40 J/cm²), reflecting its clinical use environment with trained operators.

**Total Energy Output Trends**: Despite similar energy densities, total energy output varies significantly based on beam size. Larger beam sizes in recent OHT devices (like the 3.0 cm² Lotuxs devices) can deliver substantial total energy even at moderate energy densities.

**Regulatory Timeline**: The precise transition point was July 1, 2015, with the SILKPRO device serving as the regulatory bridge from GEX to OHT classification for consumer laser hair removal devices.
